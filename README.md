# PrimeNumberChecker-LMC
A program I wrote in this Little Man Computer (https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/) to figure out if a given input, up to 999, is a prime number


Use the site above and paste the program into there. I know it's supposed to be a simple version of assembly, (The commands used can be found here: https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/help.html) so you might be able to convert that somehow, but I never went deeper than the Peterhigginson site above. I went through a few iterations, but I eventually landed a final product that was fast and gave back a yes or no answer. Just hit run, enter a number 0-999 and it will tell you whether or not it's a prime number. Also, if you want it to finish in your lifetime, I'd recommend setting the default speed to fast.

Quick instructions to run:

2. Copy the content of the "MainCode" file
3. Paste it into the left-most box of the Little Man Computer site
4. Under "OPTIONS", set the default speed to fast
5. Click "RUN"
6. Enter a number
7. See result
