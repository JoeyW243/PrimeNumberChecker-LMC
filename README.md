# PrimeNumberChecker-LMC
A program I wrote in this Little Man Computer (https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/) to figure out if a given input, up to 999, is a prime number


Use the site above and paste the program into there. I know it's supposed to be a simple version of assembly, (The commands used can be found here: https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/help.html) so you might be able to convert that somehow, but I never went deeper than the Peterhigginson site above. I went through a few iterations, but I eventually landed a final product that was fast and gave back a yes or no answer. Just hit run, enter a number 0-999 and it will tell you whether or not it's a prime number.
